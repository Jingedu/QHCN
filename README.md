# Summary
The data used in this study is a real-world dataset of junior high school grades 7 to 8 excavated from publicly available teaching resources in physics disciplines, such as textbooks, supplementary books, quiz questions, etc. It is obtained by regrouping and organizing on the basis of two previously published papers (J. Wang, Li, et al., 2023, H. Li et al., 2023), also provided by our collaborator, an education technology company. The dataset contains 16077 questions of 46 knowledge points, such as liquid pressure, levers, plan mirror imaging, friction, the reflection of light, and sound, etc. Each question is composed of the title text and the attached image, and marks the knowledge points under investigation. These questions are manually labeled by a team of professional teachers in our partner company. To ensure annotation quality and consistency, three annotators, with specialized knowledge of physics disciplines, participated in the annotation task. The entire annotation proceeds in a two-stage process, where each annotator independently annotates the whole dataset of 20744 images in Stage 1, and each of the teaching images where the annotators do not have complete agreement is negotiated by all annotators to determine the final knowledge point in Stage 2. This annotation process produces a high-quality and generalizable dataset of physics teaching images for training and validating our KBHN.
