# Summary
The data used in this study is a real-world dataset of junior high school grades 7 to 8 excavated from publicly available teaching resources in physics disciplines, such as textbooks, supplementary books, quiz questions, etc. It is obtained by regrouping and organizing on the basis of two previously published papers (J. Wang, Li, et al., 2023, H. Li et al., 2023). The dataset contains 16077 questions of 46 knowledge points, such as liquid pressure, levers, plan mirror imaging, friction, the reflection of light, and sound, etc. Each question is composed of the title text and the attached image, and marks the knowledge points under investigation. These questions are manually labeled by a team of professional teachers in our partner company. To ensure annotation quality and consistency, three annotators, with specialized knowledge of physics disciplines, participated in the annotation task. The entire annotation proceeds in a two-stage process, where each annotator independently annotates the whole dataset of 20744 images in Stage 1, and each of the teaching images where the annotators do not have complete agreement is negotiated by all annotators to determine the final knowledge point in Stage 2. This annotation process produces a high-quality and generalizable dataset of physics teaching images for training and validating our QHCN.
# Specific Examples
To quickly understand the visual question dataset, we randomly select question examples from five knowledge points, as shown in the following figure. The left column shows the knowledge point for the same row of questions, each question includes the question text and an image. It can be seen from the representative questions that the text and image of each question have common knowledge intention, and are different manifestations of the same knowledge point. Moreover, visual questions contain richer information than single-modality contents. For example, ùëû1 and ùëû3 have textual similarity, and ùëû2 and ùëû5 have visual similarity, if only relying on a single modality, it is easy to cause misjudgment. Therefore, different modalities in the same question are complementary to each other, it is necessary to integrate meaningful information from multiple modalities and consider intermodality interactions.
